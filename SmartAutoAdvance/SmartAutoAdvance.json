    "Description": "A quality-of-life plugin that automatically toggles FFXIV's \"Text Auto-Advance\" feature depending on whether or not the cutscene is voiced.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a cutscene is started, the plugin will disable Auto-Advance. Then it \"listens\" for a voice line and, if detected, enables Auto-Advance again. By default, it also automatically enables Auto-Advance if you are in a party so that you don't accidentally waste their time (this is configurable if you don't like this behaviour).",
